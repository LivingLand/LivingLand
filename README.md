- 👋 Hi, I’m @LivingLand
- 👀 I’m interested in community development both IRL and IVL, particularly eco-friendly and humane Community Economic Development that make these worlds a better place for all. I've worked in CED for over 40 years, in various projects and capacities, and I'm a lifelong Project Developer for several projects in parallel. 
- 🌱 In programming world, I'm an eyes-wide-open newbie.  I'm currently learning Solidity and C++. 
- 💞️ If you're into Community Economic Development then we might have something in common.  I’m also looking to collaborate in Exercism.org on learning projects. 
- 📫 Reach me here at GitHub.
